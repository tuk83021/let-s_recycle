# Let's Recycle
### Project Abstract
Have you ever forgotten if it’s a recycling day or not? Also, do you remember which holidays affect the trash or recycling collection schedule? 
Did you know recycling is the law in Philadelphia and you can be fined up to $300 if you don’t recycle? Do you know any of the regulations for recycling in Philadelphia? If you go to this website, https://www.philadelphiastreets.com/recycling/how-to-recycle you can figure out what you can recycle or what to keep out of the bin. However, there is a lot of information you have to memorize and it is easy to forget them. So, for this project, I would like to develop a recycling app for Android that allows users to manage their waste and recycling by receiving notifications/alarms of their trash and recycling collection day for the City of Philadelphia. With this app, the user should also be able to find out whether or not an item is recyclable by typing the name of the item and the app will tell which waste category the item belongs, and how to recycle it.
