# Let's Recycle
### Project Abstract
Have you ever forgotten if it’s a recycling day or not? Also, do you remember which holidays will affect the trash or recycling collection schedule? 
Did you know recycling is the law in Philadelphia and you can be fined up to $300 if you don’t recycle? Do you know any of the regulations for recycling in Philadelphia? If you go to this website, https://www.philadelphiastreets.com/recycling/how-to-recycle you can figure out what you can recycle or what to keep out of the bin. However, there is a lot of information you have to memorize and it is easy to forget them. So, for this project, I would like to develop a recycling app for Android that allows users to manage their waste and recycling by receiving notifications/alarms of their trash and recycling collection day for the City of Philadelphia. With this app, the user should also be able to find out whether or not an item is recyclable by typing the name of the item and the app will tell which waste category the item belongs, and how to recycle it.

### Project Relevance
This project would cover the topics discussed in this class. We would be using Unified Modeling Language (UML) to illustrate and plan the architecture of the application before code is written. This would help us to visualize how a project is or will be working. Test Driven Development would also play a major role in this project since we need to test the alarm-generating algorithm and other features to ensure it does work as intended. In addition, version control would be required in this project to track every individual change by each contributor since this project is going to be a group project. 

### Conceptual Design
To develop an Android app, there would be multiple parts to do in this project. Since notifications/alarms are the core function of this app, we would need to have both back-end and front-end developments. The back-end would be for collecting and saving the recycling collection data up-to-date. This process might be done by using open data APIs from the City of Philadelphia. Building a user interface with buttons, images, layout, input field to collect input and display the results would be the front-end.
